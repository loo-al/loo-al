# Hey I'm Alex, welcome to my Repo ✌️

### Pursuing Software Engineering / DevOps

I am proud to complete my Computer Science Bachelor at CSULB and show you some things I've learned.  
In this repo you will find the aggregate projects that I worked on over the years.  

These projects gave me chance to learn many different languages,  and I am a better software developer  
from the insights gained through these expereiences.  

From mobile development to infrastructure,  I explore the technologies that draw me in, and try to impact them  
in a postive way.
